<p>Hi, I'm Ricky Chen from Taiwan. I work in tech and am quite an extrovert, thriving on building connections with others. I'm always excited to meet new people and make new acquaintances.
</p>
<p>I grew up in a bourgeois family and have a deep appreciation for my family. While I enjoy indoor activities like coding, I also have a passion for outdoor pursuits such as snowboarding and surfing.</p>

<h2>My background</h2>
<p>I earned my bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering in Taiwan, which involved significant work in firmware and hardware design. In my first job, I was responsible for firmware coding with microcontrollers, utilizing communication protocols such as UART, I2C, SPI, and USB. I primarily used C++ and C for programming.
</p>

<p>In 2018, I encountered a significant shift in technology with the rise of AI. This prompted me to leave my previous job and redirect my career towards the AI field. I returned to college to collaborate on AI projects with my former professor, aiming to deepen my knowledge in this area. I subsequently took on a position in the lab at NCTU, where I worked on data pipelines and collected data from real-world sources. During this time, I gained experience with Python and Pandas.
</p>

<p>In 2021, I was accepted into the Computer Science program at Arizona State University and completed my degree in 2024. Most of the courses I took for my master's were focused on AI-related fields. I particularly enjoyed the AI classes and also completed several relevant database courses, which helped me manage and process data during the training phase.
